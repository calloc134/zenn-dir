OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 incorporating errata set
                                   2

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification defines how an OpenID Connect Relying Party can
   dynamically register with the End-User's OpenID Provider, providing
   information about itself to the OpenID Provider, and obtaining
   information needed to use it, including the OAuth 2.0 Client ID for
   this Relying Party.

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the
   End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
   Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-
   User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   In order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID
   Connect services for an End-User, the RP needs to register with the
   OpenID Provider to provide the OP information about itself and to
   obtain information needed to use it, including an OAuth 2.0 Client
   ID.  This specification describes how an RP can register with an OP,
   and how registration information for the RP can be retrieved.

   The previous versions of this specification are:

   o  OpenID Connect Registration 1.0 incorporating errata set 1
      [OpenID.Registration.Errata1]

   o  OpenID Connect Registration 1.0 (final)
      [OpenID.Registration.Final]

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this specification, values are quoted to
   indicate that they are to be taken literally.  When using these
   values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of
   the value.  In the HTML version of this specification, values to be
   taken literally are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

   All uses of JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] and JSON Web Encryption
   (JWE) [JWE] data structures in this specification utilize the JWS
   Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact Serialization; the JWS JSON
   Serialization and the JWE JSON Serialization are not used.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization
   Code", "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Server", "Client",
   "Client Authentication", "Client Identifier", "Client Secret", "Grant
   Type", "Protected Resource", "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token",
   "Response Type", and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749],



Sakimura, et al.                                                [Page 3]

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


   the terms "JSON Web Token (JWT)" and "Nested JWT" defined by JSON Web
   Token (JWT) [JWT], the term "Base64url Encoding" defined by JSON Web
   Signature (JWS) [JWS], and the terms defined by OpenID Connect Core
   1.0 [OpenID.Core].

   This specification defines the following additional terms:

   Client Registration Endpoint
      OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource through which a Client can be
      registered at an Authorization Server.

   Client Configuration Endpoint
      OAuth 2.0 Endpoint through which registration information for a
      registered Client can be managed.  This URL for this endpoint is
      returned by the Authorization Server in the Client Information
      Response.

   Registration Access Token
      OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token issued by the Authorization Server through
      the Client Registration Endpoint that is used to authenticate the
      caller when accessing the Client's registration information at the
      Client Configuration Endpoint.  This Access Token is associated
      with a particular registered Client.

   Initial Access Token
      OAuth 2.0 Access Token optionally issued by an Authorization
      Server granting access to its Client Registration Endpoint.  The
      contents of this token are service specific and are out of scope
      for this specification.  The means by which the Authorization
      Server issues this token and the means by which the Registration
      Endpoint validates it are also out of scope.

   IMPORTANT NOTE TO READERS: The terminology definitions in this
   section are a normative portion of this specification, imposing
   requirements upon implementations.  All the capitalized words in the
   text of this specification, such as "Client Registration Endpoint",
   reference these defined terms.  Whenever the reader encounters them,
   their definitions found in this section must be followed.

2.  Client Metadata

   Clients have metadata associated with their unique Client Identifier
   at the Authorization Server.  These can range from human-facing
   display strings, such as a Client name, to items that impact the
   security of the protocol, such as the list of valid redirect URIs.

   The Client Metadata values are used in two ways:

   o  as input values to registration requests, and

   o  as output values in registration responses and read responses.

   These Client Metadata values are used by OpenID Connect:

   redirect_uris
      REQUIRED.  Array of Redirection URI values used by the Client.
      One of these registered Redirection URI values MUST exactly match
      the "redirect_uri" parameter value used in each Authorization
      Request, with the matching performed as described in Section 6.2.1
      of [RFC3986] (Simple String Comparison).

   response_types
      OPTIONAL.  JSON [RFC8259] array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0
      "response_type" values that the Client is declaring that it will
      restrict itself to using.  If omitted, the default is that the
      Client will use only the "code" Response Type.

   grant_types
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant
      Types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to
      using.  The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are:

      *  "authorization_code": The Authorization Code Grant Type
         described in OAuth 2.0 Section 4.1.

      *  "implicit": The Implicit Grant Type described in OAuth 2.0
         Section 4.2.

      *  "refresh_token": The Refresh Token Grant Type described in
         OAuth 2.0 Section 6.

      The following table lists the correspondence between
      "response_type" values that the Client will use and "grant_type"
      values that MUST be included in the registered "grant_types" list:

      *  "code": "authorization_code"




Sakimura, et al.                                                [Page 5]

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


      *  "id_token": "implicit"

      *  "id_token token": "implicit"

      *  "code id_token": "authorization_code", "implicit"

      *  "code token": "authorization_code", "implicit"

      *  "code id_token token": "authorization_code", "implicit"

      If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the
      "authorization_code" Grant Type.

   application_type
      OPTIONAL.  Kind of the application.  The default, if omitted, is
      "web".  The defined values are "native" or "web".  Web Clients
      using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type MUST only register URLs using
      the "https" scheme as "redirect_uris"; they MUST NOT use
      "localhost" as the hostname.  Native Clients MUST only register
      "redirect_uris" using custom URI schemes or loopback URLs using
      the "http" scheme; loopback URLs use "localhost" or the IP
      loopback literals "127.0.0.1" or "[::1]" as the hostname.
      Authorization Servers MAY place additional constraints on Native
      Clients.  Authorization Servers MAY reject Redirection URI values
      using the "http" scheme, other than the loopback case for Native
      Clients.  The Authorization Server MUST verify that all the
      registered "redirect_uris" conform to these constraints.  This
      prevents sharing a Client ID across different types of Clients.

   contacts
      OPTIONAL.  Array of e-mail addresses of people responsible for
      this Client.  This might be used by some providers to enable a Web
      user interface to modify the Client information.

   client_name
      OPTIONAL.  Name of the Client to be presented to the End-User.  If
      desired, representation of this Claim in different languages and
      scripts is represented as described in Section 2.1.

   logo_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URL that references a logo for the Client application.
      If present, the server SHOULD display this image to the End-User
      during approval.  The value of this field MUST point to a valid
      image file.  If desired, representation of this Claim in different
      languages and scripts is represented as described in Section 2.1.

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


   client_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URL of the home page of the Client.  The value of this
      field MUST point to a valid Web page.  If present, the server
      SHOULD display this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.
      If desired, representation of this Claim in different languages
      and scripts is represented as described in Section 2.1.

   policy_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-
      User to read about how the profile data will be used.  The value
      of this field MUST point to a valid web page.  The OpenID Provider
      SHOULD display this URL to the End-User if it is given.  If
      desired, representation of this Claim in different languages and
      scripts is represented as described in Section 2.1.

   tos_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-
      User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service.  The
      value of this field MUST point to a valid web page.  The OpenID
      Provider SHOULD display this URL to the End-User if it is given.
      If desired, representation of this Claim in different languages
      and scripts is represented as described in Section 2.1.

   jwks_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's JWK Set [JWK] document, which MUST
      use the "https" scheme.  If the Client signs requests to the
      Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate
      signatures from the Client.  The JWK Set MAY also contain the
      Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to
      encrypt responses to the Client.  When both signing and encryption
      keys are made available, a "use" (public key use) parameter value
      is REQUIRED for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate
      each key's intended usage.  Although some algorithms allow the
      same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so
      is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it is less secure.  The JWK "x5c" parameter
      MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided.
      When used, the bare key values MUST still be present and MUST
      match those in the certificate.  The JWK Set MUST NOT contain
      private or symmetric key values.

   jwks
      OPTIONAL.  Client's JWK Set [JWK] document, passed by value.  The
      semantics of the "jwks" parameter are the same as the "jwks_uri"
      parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather
      than by reference.  This parameter is intended only to be used by
      Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the "jwks_uri"
      parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not
      have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client



Sakimura, et al.                                                [Page 7]

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


      can use "jwks_uri", it MUST NOT use "jwks".  One significant
      downside of "jwks" is that it does not enable key rotation (which
      "jwks_uri" does, as described in Section 10 of OpenID Connect Core
      1.0 [OpenID.Core]).  The "jwks_uri" and "jwks" parameters MUST NOT
      be used together.  The JWK Set MUST NOT contain private or
      symmetric key values.

   sector_identifier_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URL using the "https" scheme to be used in calculating
      Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP.  The URL references a file
      with a single JSON array of "redirect_uri" values.  Please see
      Section 5.  Providers that use pairwise "sub" (subject) values
      SHOULD utilize the "sector_identifier_uri" value provided in the
      Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.

   subject_type
      OPTIONAL. "subject_type" requested for responses to this Client.
      The "subject_types_supported" discovery parameter contains a list
      of the supported "subject_type" values for the OP.  Valid types
      include "pairwise" and "public".

   id_token_signed_response_alg
      OPTIONAL.  JWS "alg" algorithm [JWA] REQUIRED for signing the ID
      Token issued to this Client.  The value "none" MUST NOT be used as
      the ID Token "alg" value unless the Client uses only Response
      Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint
      (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow).  The
      default, if omitted, is "RS256".  The public key for validating
      the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by
      the "jwks_uri" element from OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0
      [OpenID.Discovery].

   id_token_encrypted_response_alg
      OPTIONAL.  JWE "alg" algorithm [JWA] REQUIRED for encrypting the
      ID Token issued to this Client.  If this is requested, the
      response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a
      Nested JWT, as defined in [JWT].  The default, if omitted, is that
      no encryption is performed.

   id_token_encrypted_response_enc
      OPTIONAL.  JWE "enc" algorithm [JWA] REQUIRED for encrypting the
      ID Token issued to this Client.  If
      "id_token_encrypted_response_alg" is specified, the default
      "id_token_encrypted_response_enc" value is "A128CBC-HS256".  When
      "id_token_encrypted_response_enc" is included,
      "id_token_encrypted_response_alg" MUST also be provided.

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


   userinfo_signed_response_alg
      OPTIONAL.  JWS "alg" algorithm [JWA] REQUIRED for signing UserInfo
      Responses.  If this is specified, the response will be JWT [JWT]
      serialized, and signed using JWS.  The default, if omitted, is for
      the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 [RFC3629]
      encoded JSON object using the "application/json" content-type.

   userinfo_encrypted_response_alg
      OPTIONAL.  JWE [JWE] "alg" algorithm [JWA] REQUIRED for encrypting
      UserInfo Responses.  If both signing and encryption are requested,
      the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being
      a Nested JWT, as defined in [JWT].  The default, if omitted, is
      that no encryption is performed.

   userinfo_encrypted_response_enc
      OPTIONAL.  JWE "enc" algorithm [JWA] REQUIRED for encrypting
      UserInfo Responses.  If "userinfo_encrypted_response_alg" is
      specified, the default "userinfo_encrypted_response_enc" value is
      "A128CBC-HS256".  When "userinfo_encrypted_response_enc" is
      included, "userinfo_encrypted_response_alg" MUST also be provided.

   request_object_signing_alg
      OPTIONAL.  JWS [JWS] "alg" algorithm [JWA] that MUST be used for
      signing Request Objects sent to the OP.  All Request Objects from
      this Client MUST be rejected, if not signed with this algorithm.
      Request Objects are described in Section 6.1 of OpenID Connect
      Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].  This algorithm MUST be used both when the
      Request Object is passed by value (using the "request" parameter)
      and when it is passed by reference (using the "request_uri"
      parameter).  Servers SHOULD support "RS256".  The value "none" MAY
      be used.  The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported
      by the OP and the RP MAY be used.

   request_object_encryption_alg
      OPTIONAL.  JWE [JWE] "alg" algorithm [JWA] the RP is declaring
      that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP.
      This parameter SHOULD be included when symmetric encryption will
      be used, since this signals to the OP that a "client_secret" value
      needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived,
      that might not otherwise be returned.  The RP MAY still use other
      supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request
      Objects, even when this parameter is present.  If both signing and
      encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then
      encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT, as defined in
      [JWT].  The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring
      whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.

   request_object_encryption_enc
      OPTIONAL.  JWE "enc" algorithm [JWA] the RP is declaring that it
      may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP.  If
      "request_object_encryption_alg" is specified, the default
      "request_object_encryption_enc" value is "A128CBC-HS256".  When
      "request_object_encryption_enc" is included,
      "request_object_encryption_alg" MUST also be provided.

   token_endpoint_auth_method
      OPTIONAL.  Requested Client Authentication method for the Token
      Endpoint.  The options are "client_secret_post",
      "client_secret_basic", "client_secret_jwt", "private_key_jwt", and
      "none", as described in Section 9 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0
      [OpenID.Core].  Other authentication methods MAY be defined by
      extensions.  If omitted, the default is "client_secret_basic" --
      the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme specified in Section 2.3.1 of
      OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

   token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg
      OPTIONAL.  JWS [JWS] "alg" algorithm [JWA] that MUST be used for
      signing the JWT [JWT] used to authenticate the Client at the Token
      Endpoint for the "private_key_jwt" and "client_secret_jwt"
      authentication methods.  All Token Requests using these
      authentication methods from this Client MUST be rejected, if the
      JWT is not signed with this algorithm.  Servers SHOULD support
      "RS256".  The value "none" MUST NOT be used.  The default, if
      omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY
      be used.

   default_max_age
      OPTIONAL.  Default Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the
      End-User MUST be actively authenticated if the End-User was
      authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds.
      The "max_age" request parameter overrides this default value.  If
      omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.

   require_auth_time
      OPTIONAL.  Boolean value specifying whether the "auth_time" Claim
      in the ID Token is REQUIRED.  It is REQUIRED when the value is
      "true".  (If this is "false", the "auth_time" Claim can still be
      dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token
      using the "claims" request parameter described in Section 5.5.1 of
      OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].)  If omitted, the default
      value is "false".

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


   default_acr_values
      OPTIONAL.  Default requested Authentication Context Class
      Reference values.  Array of strings that specifies the default
      "acr" values that the OP is being requested to use for processing
      requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of
      preference.  The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the
      authentication performed is returned as the "acr" Claim Value in
      the issued ID Token.  The "acr" Claim is requested as a Voluntary
      Claim by this parameter.  The "acr_values_supported" discovery
      element contains a list of the supported "acr" values supported by
      the OP.  Values specified in the "acr_values" request parameter or
      an individual "acr" Claim request override these default values.

   initiate_login_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URI using the "https" scheme that a third party can use
      to initiate a login by the RP, as specified in Section 4 of OpenID
      Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].  The URI MUST accept requests via
      both "GET" and "POST".  The Client MUST understand the
      "login_hint" and "iss" parameters and SHOULD support the
      "target_link_uri" parameter.

   request_uris
      OPTIONAL.  Array of "request_uri" values that are pre-registered
      by the RP for use at the OP.  These URLs MUST use the "https"
      scheme unless the target Request Object is signed in a way that is
      verifiable by the OP.  Servers MAY cache the contents of the files
      referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they
      are used in a request.  OPs can require that "request_uri" values
      used be pre-registered with the "require_request_uri_registration"
      discovery parameter.

      If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI
      values SHOULD include the base64url-encoded SHA-256 hash value of
      the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI
      fragment.  If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that
      signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old
      fragment value is no longer valid.

   Additional Client Metadata parameters MAY also be used.  Some are
   defined by other specifications, such as OpenID Connect RP-Initiated
   Logout 1.0 [OpenID.RPInitiated].

2.1.  Metadata Languages and Scripts

   Human-readable Client Metadata values and Client Metadata values that
   reference human-readable values MAY be represented in multiple
   languages and scripts.  For example, values such as "client_name",
   "tos_uri", "policy_uri", "logo_uri", and "client_uri" might have



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 11]

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


   multiple locale-specific values in some Client registrations.

   To specify the languages and scripts, BCP47 [RFC5646] language tags
   are added to Client Metadata member names, delimited by a "#"
   character.  The same syntax is used for representing languages and
   scripts for Client Metadata as is used for Claims, as described in
   Section 5.2 (Claims Languages and Scripts) of OpenID Connect Core 1.0
   [OpenID.Core].

   If such a human-readable field is sent without a language tag,
   parties using it MUST NOT make any assumptions about the language,
   character set, or script of the string value, and the string value
   MUST be used as-is wherever it is presented in a user interface.  To
   facilitate interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that any human-
   readable fields sent without language tags contain values suitable
   for display on a wide variety of systems.

3.  Client Registration Endpoint

   The Client Registration Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource
   through which a new Client registration can be requested.  The OpenID
   Provider MAY require an Initial Access Token that is provisioned out-
   of-band (in a manner that is out of scope for this specification) to
   restrict registration requests to only authorized Clients or
   developers.  The Client Registration Endpoint SHOULD support the use
   of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and/or other methods
   as appropriate to enable JavaScript Clients and other Browser-Based
   Clients to access it.

   To support open Dynamic Registration, the Client Registration
   Endpoint SHOULD accept registration requests without OAuth 2.0 Access
   Tokens.  These requests MAY be rate-limited or otherwise limited to
   prevent a denial-of-service attack on the Client Registration
   Endpoint.  If an Initial Access Token is required for Client
   registration, the Client Registration Endpoint MUST be able to accept
   these Access Tokens in the manner described in the OAuth 2.0 Bearer
   Token Usage [RFC6750] specification.

3.1.  Client Registration Request

   To register a new Client at the Authorization Server, the Client
   sends an HTTP "POST" message to the Client Registration Endpoint with
   any Client Metadata parameters that the Client chooses to specify for
   itself during the registration.  The Authorization Server assigns
   this Client a unique Client Identifier, optionally assigns a Client
   Secret, and associates the Metadata given in the request with the
   issued Client Identifier.  The Authorization Server MAY provision
   default values for any items omitted in the Client Metadata.

   The Client sends an HTTP "POST" to the Client Registration Endpoint
   with a content type of "application/json" with the parameters
   represented as top-level members of the root JSON object.

   The following is a non-normative example registration request (with
   line wraps within values for display purposes only):

          #qpXaRLh_n93TTR9F252ValdatUQvQiJi5BDub2BeznA"]
     }

3.2.  Client Registration Response

   Upon successful registration, the Client Registration Endpoint
   returns the newly created Client Identifier and, if applicable, a
   Client Secret, along with all registered Metadata about this Client,
   including any fields provisioned by the Authorization Server itself.
   The Authorization Server MAY reject or replace any of the Client's
   requested field values, other than the "redirect_uris" value, and
   substitute them with suitable values.  If this happens, the
   Authorization Server MUST include these fields in the response to the
   Client.  An Authorization Server MAY ignore values provided by the
   client and MUST ignore any fields sent by the Client that it does not
   understand.

   The response MAY contain a Registration Access Token that can be used
   by the Client to perform subsequent operations upon the resulting
   Client registration.



Sakimura, et al.                                               [Page 14]

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


   A successful response SHOULD use the HTTP 201 Created status code and
   return a JSON document [RFC8259] using the "application/json" content
   type with the following fields and the Client Metadata parameters as
   top-level members of the root JSON object:

   client_id
      REQUIRED.  Unique Client Identifier.  It MUST NOT be currently
      valid for any other registered Client.

   client_secret
      OPTIONAL.  Client Secret.  The same Client Secret value MUST NOT
      be assigned to multiple Clients.  This value is used by
      Confidential Clients to authenticate to the Token Endpoint, as
      described in Section 2.3.1 of OAuth 2.0, and for the derivation of
      symmetric encryption key values, as described in Section 10.2 of
      OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].  It is not needed for
      Clients selecting a "token_endpoint_auth_method" of
      "private_key_jwt" unless symmetric encryption will be used.

   registration_access_token
      OPTIONAL.  Registration Access Token that can be used at the
      Client Configuration Endpoint to perform subsequent operations
      upon the Client registration.

   registration_client_uri
      OPTIONAL.  Location of the Client Configuration Endpoint where the
      Registration Access Token can be used to perform subsequent
      operations upon the resulting Client registration.  This URL MUST
      use the "https" scheme.  Implementations MUST either return both a
      Client Configuration Endpoint and a Registration Access Token or
      neither of them.

   client_id_issued_at
      OPTIONAL.  Time at which the Client Identifier was issued.  Its
      value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from
      1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

   client_secret_expires_at
      REQUIRED if "client_secret" is issued.  Time at which the
      "client_secret" will expire or 0 if it will not expire.  Its value
      is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-
      01T00:00:00Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

3.3.  Client Registration Error Response

   When an OAuth error condition occurs, the Client Registration
   Endpoint returns an Error Response as defined in Section 3 of the
   OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750] specification.

   When a registration error condition occurs, the Client Registration
   Endpoint returns a HTTP 400 Bad Request status code including a JSON
   object describing the error in the response body.

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


   The JSON object describing the error contains two members:

   error
      Error code.

   error_description
      Additional text description of the error for debugging.

   Other members MAY also be used.

   This specification defines the following error codes:

   invalid_redirect_uri
      The value of one or more "redirect_uris" is invalid.

   invalid_client_metadata
      The value of one of the Client Metadata fields is invalid and the
      server has rejected this request.  Note that an Authorization
      Server MAY choose to substitute a valid value for any requested
      parameter of a Client's Metadata.

   Other error codes MAY also be used.

   The following is a non-normative example error response:

     HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
     Content-Type: application/json
     Cache-Control: no-store

     {
      "error": "invalid_redirect_uri",
      "error_description": "One or more redirect_uri values are invalid"
     }

4.  Client Configuration Endpoint

   The Client Configuration Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource
   that MAY be provisioned by the server for a specific Client to be
   able to view and update its registered information.  The Client MUST
   use its Registration Access Token in all calls to this endpoint as an
   OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token [RFC6750].  The Client Configuration Endpoint
   SHOULD support the use of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS]
   and/or other methods as appropriate to enable JavaScript Clients and
   other Browser-Based Clients to access it.

   Operations on this endpoint are switched through the use of different
   HTTP methods [RFC7231].  The only method defined for use at this
   endpoint by this specification is the HTTP "GET" method.

4.1.  Forming the Client Configuration Endpoint URL

   If a Client Configuration Endpoint and a Registration Access Token
   are returned by the initial registration of the Client, the
   Authorization Server MUST provide the Client with the fully qualified
   URL in the "registration_client_uri" element of the Client
   Registration Response, per Section 3.2.  The Authorization Server
   MUST NOT expect the Client to construct or discover this URL on its
   own.  The Client MUST use the URL as given by the server and MUST NOT
   construct this URL from component pieces.

   Depending on deployment characteristics, the Client Configuration
   Endpoint URL can take any number of forms.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   this endpoint URL be formed through the use of a server-constructed
   URL string which combines the Client Registration Endpoint's URL and
   the issued Client ID for this Client, with the latter as either a
   path parameter or a query parameter.  For example, a Client with the
   Client ID "s6BhdRkqt3" could be given a Client Configuration Endpoint
   URL of "https://server.example.com/register/s6BhdRkqt3" (path
   parameter) or of
   "https://server.example.com/register?client_id=s6BhdRkqt3" (query
   parameter).  In both of these cases, the Client simply uses the URL
   as given.

   These common patterns can help the Server to more easily determine
   the Client to which the request pertains, which MUST be matched
   against the Client to which the Registration Access Token was issued.
   If desired, the Server MAY simply return the Client Registration
   Endpoint URL as the Client Configuration Endpoint URL and change
   behavior based on the authentication context provided by the
   Registration Access Token.

4.2.  Client Read Request

   If the initial registration of the Client returned a Client
   Configuration Endpoint and a Registration Access Token, the current
   configuration of the Client on the Authorization Server can be read
   by making an HTTP "GET" request to the Client Configuration Endpoint
   with the Registration Access Token.  This operation SHOULD be
   idempotent -- not causing changes to the Client configuration.

   The following is a non-normative example read request:

     GET /connect/register?client_id=s6BhdRkqt3 HTTP/1.1
     Accept: application/json
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Bearer this.is.an.access.token.value.ffx83

4.3.  Client Read Response

   Upon a successful read operation, the Authorization Server SHOULD
   return all registered Metadata about this Client, including any
   fields provisioned by the Authorization Server itself.  Note that
   some values, including the "client_secret" value, might have been
   updated since the initial registration.  The mechanisms for such
   updates are beyond the scope of this specification.  However, since
   Read operations are intended to be idempotent, the Client Read
   Request itself SHOULD NOT cause changes to the Client's registered
   Metadata values.

   The Authorization Server need not include the
   "registration_access_token" or "registration_client_uri" value in
   this response unless they have been updated.

   A successful response SHOULD use the HTTP 200 OK status code and
   return a JSON document [RFC8259] using the "application/json" content
   type with the Client Metadata values as top-level members of the root
   JSON object.

  }

4.4.  Client Read Error Response

   If the Registration Access Token used to make this request is not
   valid, the server MUST respond with an error as described in OAuth
   Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750].

   If the Client does not exist on this server, the Client is invalid,
   or the Registration Access Token used is invalid, the server MUST
   respond with the HTTP 401 Unauthorized status code.  If the Client
   does not have permission to read its record, the server MUST return
   an HTTP 403 Forbidden.  Note that for security reasons, to inhibit
   brute force attacks, endpoints MUST NOT return the HTTP 404 Not Found

5.  "sector_identifier_uri" Validation

   The sector identifier list provides a way for a group of Web sites
   under single administrative control to have consistent pairwise "sub"
   values, independent of their domain names, as described in Section
   8.1 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].  It also provides a way
   for Clients to change "redirect_uri" domains without having to re-
   register all of their users.

   The value of the "sector_identifier_uri" MUST be a URL using the
   "https" scheme that references a JSON file containing an array of
   "redirect_uri" values.  The values registered in "redirect_uris" MUST
   be included in the elements of the array, or registration MUST fail.
   This MUST be validated at registration time; there is no requirement
   for the OP to retain the contents of this JSON file or to retrieve or
   revalidate its contents in the future.

   The following is a non-normative example request to and reply from a
   "sector_identifier_uri":

     GET /file_of_redirect_uris.json HTTP/1.1

6.  String Operations

   Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing values in
   the messages to known values.  For example, the member names in the
   Client registration response might be compared to specific member
   names such as "client_id".  Comparing Unicode [UNICODE] strings,
   however, has significant security implications.

   Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings
   MUST be performed as specified below:

   1.  Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of Unicode
       code points.

   2.  Unicode Normalization [USA15] MUST NOT be applied at any point to
       either the JSON string or to the string it is to be compared
       against.

   3.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
       Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

7.  Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

8.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification defines features used by both Relying Parties and
   OpenID Providers that choose to implement Dynamic Client
   Registration.  All of these Relying Parties and OpenID Providers MUST
   implement the features that are listed in this specification as being
   "REQUIRED" or are described with a "MUST".

   This specification is compatible with the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client
   Registration Protocol [RFC7591].  Implementations MAY use additional
   Client Metadata values defined by [RFC7591], such as
   "software_statement", should they facilitate their use cases.
   Implementations wanting to support additional operations defined in
   OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Management Protocol [RFC7592],
   such as Update, can do so using that specification, while being
   mindful that the specification is experimental.

8.1.  Compatibility Notes

   NOTE: Potential compatibility issues that were previously described
   in the original version of this specification have since been
   addressed.

8.2.  Implementation Notes on Stateless Dynamic Client Registration

   In some deployments, it is advantageous to enable Clients to obtain
   the information necessary to interact with the Authorization Server,
   such as a Client Identifier, without the requirement that state about
   the Client be stored at the Authorization Server.  The interfaces
   defined by this specification can be used for stateless dynamic
   client registration.

   One means of doing this is to encode necessary registration
   information about the Client into the "client_id" value returned by
   the initial registration of the Client.  This has the effect of
   having the Client store this information, rather than the
   Authorization Server.  The particular encodings used by different
   Authorization Servers will differ.

   When stateless dynamic client registration is used by the
   Authorization Server, read operations are likely to not be possible,
   because issuing a Registration Access Token might require per-Client
   state at the Authorization Server.  In that case, no Client
   Configuration Endpoint or Registration Access Token will be returned
   by the initial registration of the Client.

9.  Security Considerations

   Since requests to the Client Registration Endpoint result in the
   transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and
   response), all communication with the Registration Endpoint MUST
   utilize TLS.  See Section 9.3 for more information on using TLS.

9.1.  Impersonation

   A rogue RP might use the logo for the legitimate RP, which it is
   trying to impersonate.  An OP needs to take steps to mitigate this
   phishing risk, since the logo could confuse users into thinking they
   are logging in to the legitimate RP.  An OP could also warn if the
   domain/site of the logo does not match the domain/site of registered
   Redirection URIs.  An OP can also make warnings against untrusted RPs
   in all cases, especially if they are dynamically registered, have not
   been trusted by any users at the OP before, and want to use the logo
   feature.

   In a situation where the Authorization Server is supporting open
   Client registration, it needs to be extremely careful with any URL
   provided by the Client that will be displayed to the End-User (e.g.,
   "logo_uri" and "policy_uri").  A rogue Client could specify a
   registration request with a reference to a drive-by download in the
   "policy_uri".  The Authorization Server SHOULD check to see if the
   "logo_uri" and "policy_uri" have the same host as the hosts defined
   in the array of "redirect_uris".

9.2.  Native Code Leakage

   Implementers should be aware that on iOS, information is returned to
   native applications using custom URI schemes, but multiple
   applications can register the same URI scheme.  In this case, it is
   nondeterministic which application receives the information.  This
   can result in an Authorization Code being leaked to the wrong
   application.  Several possible solutions to this have been proposed
   and are being discussed in the IETF OAuth working group.  It is
   expected that a standard solution to this problem will be developed
   there.  At that point, an extension to OpenID Connect may be
   published describing how to apply that solution to OpenID Connect.

9.3.  TLS Requirements

   Implementations MUST support TLS.  Which version(s) ought to be
   implemented will vary over time and depend on the widespread
   deployment and known security vulnerabilities at the time of
   implementation.  Implementations SHOULD follow the guidance in BCP
   195 [RFC8996] [RFC9325], which provides recommendations and

                     OpenID Connect Registration 1.0       December 2023


   requirements for improving the security of deployed services that use
   TLS.

   To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
   confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS with a
   ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and integrity protection.

   Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check MUST be
   performed, per RFC 6125 [RFC6125].
