        OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 incorporating errata set 2

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification defines a mechanism for an OpenID Connect Relying
   Party to discover the End-User's OpenID Provider and obtain
   information needed to interact with it, including its OAuth 2.0
   endpoint locations.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the
   End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
   Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-
   User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   In order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID
   Connect services for an End-User, the RP needs to know where the
   OpenID Provider is.  OpenID Connect uses WebFinger [RFC7033] to
   locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User.  This process is
   described in Section 2.

   Once the OpenID Provider has been identified, the configuration
   information for that OP is retrieved from a well-known location as a
   JSON [RFC8259] document, including its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.
   This process is described in Section 4.

   The previous versions of this specification are:

   o  OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 incorporating errata set 1
      [OpenID.Discovery.Errata1]

   o  OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 (final) [OpenID.Discovery.Final]

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   In the .txt version of this specification, values are quoted to
   indicate that they are to be taken literally.  When using these
   values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of
   the value.  In the HTML version of this specification, values to be
   taken literally are indicated by the use of "this fixed-width font".

   All uses of JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] and JSON Web Encryption
   (JWE) [JWE] data structures in this specification utilize the JWS
   Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact Serialization; the JWS JSON
   Serialization and the JWE JSON Serialization are not used.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Authorization Code",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Server", "Client", "Client



Sakimura, et al.                                                [Page 3]

                      OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0         December 2023


   Authentication", "Client Secret", "Grant Type", "Response Type", and
   "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], the terms "Claim
   Name", "Claim Value", and "JSON Web Token (JWT)" defined by JSON Web
   Token (JWT) [JWT], and the terms defined by OpenID Connect Core 1.0
   [OpenID.Core] and OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices
   [OAuth.Responses].

   This specification also defines the following terms:

   Resource
      Entity that is the target of a request in WebFinger.

   Host
      Server where a WebFinger service is hosted.

   Identifier
      Value that uniquely characterizes an Entity in a specific context.

      NOTE: This specification defines various kinds of Identifiers,
      designed for use in different contexts.  Examples include URLs
      using the "https" scheme and e-mail addresses.

   IMPORTANT NOTE TO READERS: The terminology definitions in this
   section are a normative portion of this specification, imposing
   requirements upon implementations.  All the capitalized words in the
   text of this specification, such as "Identifier", reference these
   defined terms.  Whenever the reader encounters them, their
   definitions found in this section must be followed.

2.  OpenID Provider Issuer Discovery

   OpenID Provider Issuer discovery is the process of determining the
   location of the OpenID Provider.

   Issuer discovery is OPTIONAL; if a Relying Party knows the OP's
   Issuer location through an out-of-band mechanism, it can skip this
   step and proceed to Section 4.

   The following information is needed to perform issuer discovery using
   WebFinger [RFC7033]:

   resource
      Identifier for the target End-User that is the subject of the
      discovery request.

   host
      Server where a WebFinger service is hosted.

   rel
      URI identifying the type of service whose location is being
      requested.

   OpenID Connect uses the following discoverable "rel" value in
   WebFinger [RFC7033]:

   +----------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | Rel Type             | URI                                        |
   +----------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | OpenID Connect       | http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer |
   | Issuer               |                                            |
   +----------------------+--------------------------------------------+

   To start discovery of OpenID endpoints, the End-User supplies an
   Identifier to the Relying Party.  Any Web input form MUST employ
   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention [OWASP.CSRF].

   The RP applies normalization rules to the Identifier to determine the
   Resource and Host.  Then it makes an HTTP "GET" request to the Host's
   WebFinger [RFC7033] endpoint with the "resource" parameter to obtain
   the location of the requested service.  Use of the "rel" parameter in
   the request with a value of
   "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer" is also RECOMMENDED to
   narrow the response to the specific link relation type needed.

   All WebFinger communication MUST utilize TLS in the manner described
   in Section 7.1.  The WebFinger endpoint SHOULD support the use of
   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and/or other methods as



Sakimura, et al.                                                [Page 5]

                      OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0         December 2023


   appropriate to enable JavaScript Clients and other Browser-Based
   Clients to access it.

   The Issuer location MUST be returned in the WebFinger response as the
   value of the "href" member of a "links" array element with "rel"
   member value "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer".  (Per
   Section 7 of WebFinger [RFC7033], obtaining the WebFinger response
   may first involve following some redirects.)

   The returned Issuer location MUST be a URI RFC 3986 [RFC3986] with a
   scheme component that MUST be "https", a host component, and
   optionally, port and path components and no query or fragment
   components.  Note that since the Host and Resource values determined
   from the user input Identifier, as described in Section 2.1, are used
   as input to a WebFinger request, which can return an Issuer value
   using a completely different scheme, host, port, and path, no
   relationship can be assumed between the user input Identifier string
   and the resulting Issuer location.

2.1.  Identifier Normalization

   The purpose of Identifier normalization is to determine normalized
   Resource and Host values from the user input Identifier.  These are
   then used as WebFinger request parameters to discover the Issuer
   location.

   The user input Identifier SHOULD be a URL or URI relative reference
   defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  The user input Identifier MUST
   include the authority component.

   NOTE: A URI relative reference includes a string that looks like an
   e-mail address in the form of "userinfo@host".  This is a valid
   authority component of a URI but excludes various possible extra
   strings allowed in "addr-spec" syntax of RFC 5322 [RFC5322].

   The Identifier normalization rules MAY be extended by additional
   specifications to enable other identifier types such as telephone
   numbers or XRIs [XRI_Syntax_2.0] to also be used.

2.1.1.  User Input Identifier Types

   A user input Identifier can be categorized into the following types,
   which require different normalization processes:

   1.  User input Identifiers starting with the XRI [XRI_Syntax_2.0]
       global context symbols ('=','@', and '!') are RESERVED.
       Processing of these identifiers is out of scope for this
       specification.



Sakimura, et al.                                                [Page 6]

                      OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0         December 2023


   2.  All other user input Identifiers MUST be treated as a URI in one
       of the forms "scheme "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [
       "#" fragment ]" or "authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#"
       fragment ]" or "scheme ":" path-rootless", per RFC 3986
       [RFC3986].

   NOTE: The user input Identifier MAY be in the form of
   "userinfo@host".  For the End-User, this would normally be perceived
   as being an e-mail address.  However, it is also a valid userpart "@"
   host section of an "acct" URI [RFC7565], and this specification
   treats it such as to exclude various extra strings allowed in
   "addr-spec" of RFC 5322 [RFC5322].

2.1.2.  Normalization Steps

   A string of any other type is interpreted as a URI in one of the
   forms "scheme "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#"
   fragment ]" or "authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment
   ]" or "scheme ":" path-rootless" per RFC 3986 [RFC3986] and is
   normalized according to the following rules:

   1.  If the user input Identifier does not have an RFC 3986 [RFC3986]
       scheme component, the string is interpreted as "[userinfo "@"]
       host [":" port] path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]" per
       RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  Examples are "example.com",
       "joe@example.com", "example.com/joe", and "example.com:8080".

   2.  If the userinfo and host components are present and all of the
       scheme, path, query, port, and fragment components are absent,
       the "acct" scheme is assumed.  In this case, the normalized URI
       is formed by prefixing "acct:" to the string as the scheme.  Per
       The 'acct' URI Scheme [RFC7565], if there is an at-sign character
       ('@') in the userinfo component, it needs to be percent-encoded,
       as described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  Examples are
       "joe@example.com" and "Jane.Doe@example.com".

   3.  For all other inputs without a scheme component, the "https"
       scheme is assumed, and the normalized URI is formed by prefixing
       "https://" to the string as the scheme.  Examples are
       "example.com", "example.com/joe", "example.com:8080", and
       "joe@example.com:8080".

   4.  When the input contains an explicit scheme such as "acct" or
       "https" that matches the RFC 3986 "scheme ":" path-rootless"
       syntax, no input normalization is performed.  Examples are
       "https://example.com", "https://example.com/joe",
       "https://joe@example.com:8080", and "acct:joe@example.com".




Sakimura, et al.                                                [Page 7]

                      OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0         December 2023


   5.  If the resulting URI contains a fragment component, it MUST be
       stripped off, together with the fragment delimiter character "#".

   The WebFinger [RFC7033] Resource in this case is the resulting URI,
   and the WebFinger Host is the authority component.

   NOTE: Since the definition of "authority" in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] is "[
   userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]", it is legal to have a user input
   identifier like "userinfo@host:port", e.g., "alice@example.com:8080".

2.2.  Non-Normative Examples

2.2.1.  User Input using E-Mail Address Syntax

   To find the Issuer for the given user input in the form of an e-mail
   address "joe@example.com", the WebFinger parameters are as follows:

   +---------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | WebFinger Parameter | Value                                      |
   +---------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | resource            | acct:joe@example.com                       |
   |                     |                                            |
   | host                | example.com                                |
   |                     |                                            |
   | rel                 | http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer |
   +---------------------+--------------------------------------------+

   Note that in this case, the "acct:" scheme [RFC7565] is prepended to
   the Identifier.

                      OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0         December 2023


   The RP would make the following WebFinger request to discover the
   Issuer location (with line wraps within lines for display purposes
   only):

     GET /.well-known/webfinger
       ?resource=acct%3Ajoe%40example.com
       &rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer
       HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/jrd+json

     {
      "subject": "acct:joe@example.com",
      "links":
       [
        {
         "rel": "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",
         "href": "https://server.example.com"
        }
       ]
     }

2.2.2.  User Input using URL Syntax

   To find the Issuer for the given URL, "https://example.com/joe", the
   WebFinger parameters are as follows:

   +---------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | WebFinger Parameter | Value                                      |
   +---------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | resource            | https://example.com/joe                    |

        }
       ]
     }

2.2.3.  User Input using Hostname and Port Syntax

   If the user input is in the form of "host:port", e.g., example.com:
   8080, then it is assumed as the authority component of the URL.

   To find the Issuer for the given hostname, "example.com:8080", the
   WebFinger parameters are as follows:

   +---------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | WebFinger Parameter | Value                                      |

   NOTE: It is common for sites to use e-mail addresses as local
   identifiers for accounts at those sites, even though the domain in
   the e-mail address is not one controlled by the site.  For instance,
   the site "example.org" might have a local account named
   "joe@example.com".  This specification uses "acct:" URIs as defined
   by [RFC7565] to represent such accounts during WebFinger discovery.
   Such an example is "acct:joe%40example.com@example.org".  End-Users
   MAY input values like "joe@example.com@example.org" to initiate
   discovery on such accounts.

3.  OpenID Provider Metadata

   OpenID Providers have metadata describing their configuration.  These
   OpenID Provider Metadata values are used by OpenID Connect:

   issuer
      REQUIRED.  URL using the "https" scheme with no query or fragment
      components that the OP asserts as its Issuer Identifier.  If
      Issuer discovery is supported (see Section 2), this value MUST be
      identical to the issuer value returned by WebFinger.  This also
      MUST be identical to the "iss" Claim value in ID Tokens issued
      from this Issuer.

   authorization_endpoint
      REQUIRED.  URL of the OP's OAuth 2.0 Authorization Endpoint
      [OpenID.Core].  This URL MUST use the "https" scheme and MAY
      contain port, path, and query parameter components.

   token_endpoint
      URL of the OP's OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint [OpenID.Core].  This is
      REQUIRED unless only the Implicit Flow is used.  This URL MUST use
      the "https" scheme and MAY contain port, path, and query parameter
      components.

   userinfo_endpoint
      RECOMMENDED.  URL of the OP's UserInfo Endpoint [OpenID.Core].
      This URL MUST use the "https" scheme and MAY contain port, path,
      and query parameter components.

   jwks_uri
      REQUIRED.  URL of the OP's JWK Set [JWK] document, which MUST use
      the "https" scheme.  This contains the signing key(s) the RP uses
      to validate signatures from the OP.  The JWK Set MAY also contain
      the Server's encryption key(s), which are used by RPs to encrypt
      requests to the Server.  When both signing and encryption keys are
      made available, a "use" (public key use) parameter value is
      REQUIRED for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each
      key's intended usage.  Although some algorithms allow the same key
      to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is NOT
      RECOMMENDED, as it is less secure.  The JWK "x5c" parameter MAY be
      used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided.  When
      used, the bare key values MUST still be present and MUST match
      those in the certificate.  The JWK Set MUST NOT contain private or
      symmetric key values.

   registration_endpoint
      RECOMMENDED.  URL of the OP's Dynamic Client Registration Endpoint
      [OpenID.Registration], which MUST use the "https" scheme.

   scopes_supported
      RECOMMENDED.  JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0
      [RFC6749] scope values that this server supports.  The server MUST
      support the "openid" scope value.  Servers MAY choose not to
      advertise some supported scope values even when this parameter is
      used, although those defined in [OpenID.Core] SHOULD be listed, if
      supported.

   response_types_supported
      REQUIRED.  JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0
      "response_type" values that this OP supports.  Dynamic OpenID
      Providers MUST support the "code", "id_token", and the "id_token
      token" Response Type values.

   response_modes_supported
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0
      "response_mode" values that this OP supports, as specified in
      OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices

      REQUIRED.  JSON array containing a list of the JWS signing
      algorithms ("alg" values) supported by the OP for the ID Token to
      encode the Claims in a JWT [JWT].  The algorithm "RS256" MUST be
      included.  The value "none" MAY be supported but MUST NOT be used
      unless the Response Type used returns no ID Token from the
      Authorization Endpoint (such as when using the Authorization Code

   accessed by Clients SHOULD support the use of Cross-Origin Resource
   Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and/or other methods as appropriate to enable
   JavaScript Clients and other Browser-Based Clients to access them.
   The use of CORS at the Authorization Endpoint is NOT RECOMMENDED as
   it is redirected to by the client and not directly accessed.

   Additional OpenID Provider Metadata parameters MAY also be used.
   Some are defined by other specifications, such as OpenID Connect
   Session Management 1.0 [OpenID.Session].

4.  Obtaining OpenID Provider Configuration Information

   Using the Issuer location discovered as described in Section 2 or by
   other means, the OpenID Provider's configuration information can be
   retrieved.

   OpenID Providers supporting Discovery MUST make a JSON document
   available at the path formed by concatenating the string
   "/.well-known/openid-configuration" to the Issuer.  The syntax and
   semantics of ".well-known" are defined in RFC 5785 [RFC5785] and
   apply to the Issuer value when it contains no path component.
   "openid-configuration" MUST point to a JSON document compliant with
   this specification and MUST be returned using the "application/json"
   content type.  The "openid-configuration" endpoint SHOULD support the
   use of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and/or other
   methods as appropriate to enable JavaScript Clients and other
   Browser-Based Clients to access it.

4.1.  OpenID Provider Configuration Request

   An OpenID Provider's configuration information MUST be retrieved
   using an HTTP "GET" request at the previously specified path.

   The RP would make the following request to the Issuer
   "https://example.com" to obtain its Configuration information, since
   the Issuer contains no path component:


     GET /.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

   If the Issuer value contains a path component, any terminating "/"
   MUST be removed before appending "/.well-known/openid-configuration".
   The RP would make the following request to the Issuer
   "https://example.com/issuer1" to obtain its configuration
   information, since the Issuer contains a path component:


     GET /issuer1/.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

   Using path components enables supporting multiple issuers per host.
   This is required in some multi-tenant hosting configurations.  This
   use of ".well-known" is for supporting multiple issuers per host;
   unlike its use in RFC 5785 [RFC5785], it does not provide general
   information about the host.

                      OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0         December 2023


4.2.  OpenID Provider Configuration Response

   The response is a set of Claims about the OpenID Provider's
   configuration, including all necessary endpoints and public key
   location information.  A successful response MUST use the 200 OK HTTP
   status code and return a JSON object using the "application/json"
   content type that contains a set of Claims as its members that are a
   subset of the Metadata values defined in Section 3.  Other Claims MAY
   also be returned.

   Claims that return multiple values are represented as JSON arrays.
   Claims with zero elements MUST be omitted from the response.

   An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

   The following is a non-normative example response:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json

     {

4.3.  OpenID Provider Configuration Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

   The "issuer" value returned MUST be identical to the Issuer URL that
   was used as the prefix to "/.well-known/openid-configuration" to
   retrieve the configuration information.  This MUST also be identical
   to the "iss" Claim value in ID Tokens issued from this Issuer.

5.  String Operations

   Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing values in
   the messages to known values.  For example, the member names in the
   provider configuration response might be compared to specific member
   names such as "issuer".  Comparing Unicode [UNICODE] strings,
   however, has significant security implications.

   Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings
   MUST be performed as specified below:

   1.  Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of Unicode
       code points.

   2.  Unicode Normalization [USA15] MUST NOT be applied at any point to
       either the JSON string or to the string it is to be compared
       against.

   3.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
       Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

6.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification defines features used by both Relying Parties and
   OpenID Providers that choose to implement Discovery.  All of these
   Relying Parties and OpenID Providers MUST implement the features that
   are listed in this specification as being "REQUIRED" or are described
   with a "MUST".  No other implementation considerations for
   implementations of Discovery are defined by this specification.

6.1.  Compatibility Notes

   NOTE: Potential compatibility issues that were previously described
   in the original version of this specification have since been
   addressed.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  TLS Requirements

   Implementations MUST support TLS.  Which version(s) ought to be
   implemented will vary over time and depend on the widespread
   deployment and known security vulnerabilities at the time of
   implementation.  Implementations SHOULD follow the guidance in BCP
   195 [RFC8996] [RFC9325], which provides recommendations and
   requirements for improving the security of deployed services that use
   TLS.

   To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
   confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS with a
   ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and integrity protection.

   Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check MUST be
   performed, per RFC 6125 [RFC6125].

7.2.  Impersonation Attacks

   TLS certificate checking MUST be performed by the RP, as described in
   Section 7.1, when making an OpenID Provider Configuration Request.
   Checking that the server certificate is valid for the Issuer URL
   prevents man-in-middle and DNS-based attacks.  These attacks could
   cause an RP to be tricked into using an attacker's keys and
   endpoints, which would enable impersonation of the legitimate Issuer.
   If an attacker can accomplish this, they can access the accounts of
   any existing users at the affected RP that can be logged into using
   the OP that they are impersonating.

   An attacker may also attempt to impersonate an OpenID Provider by
   publishing a Discovery document that contains an "issuer" Claim using
   the Issuer URL of the OP being impersonated, but with its own
   endpoints and signing keys.  This would enable it to issue ID Tokens
   as that OP, if accepted by the RP.  To prevent this, RPs MUST ensure
   that the Issuer URL they are using for the Configuration Request
   exactly matches the value of the "issuer" Claim in the OP Metadata
   document received by the RP and that this also exactly matches the
   "iss" Claim value in ID Tokens that are supposed to be from that
   Issuer.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Well-Known URI Registry
